        <p>I'm 24 years old and I live in Milan. I just graduated at Iulm University. I'm very passionata about affective writing, strategic comunicatin but also marketing a 
        and social media so I'm searching for a job in this fields, but also I would like to get out of my confort zone and try something more challenging for me. I love working in teams, I consider myself to be a very collaborative person, I'm outgoing and always positive.
        I think I would perform better in big business, but I also wouldn't mind to work for a little start up.
        In my free time I love reading, watching movies and cooking.</p>
